# Ocean theme for iTerm.app

This is an iTerm.app theme for OS X based on the [base16 Ocean theme](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#ocean) and adapted from @mdo's [Terminal.app version](https://github.com/mdo/ocean-terminal).

A little about base16:

> Base16 provides carefully chosen syntax highlighting and a default set of sixteen colors suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Terminal prompt

For more info on customizing your terminal prompt, check out @mdo's `.bash_profile` in
[mdo/config](https://github.com/mdo/config/blob/master/.bash_profile#L1-L13) repo. Copy and paste that into your own `.bash_profile` and reload iTerm or source your profile: `. ~/.bash_profile`. For even more info on terminal prompts, check out the [Bash PS1 generator](https://www.kirsle.net/wizards/ps1.html).
